    <string name="ibw2">\t\t\t\t\tAesthet(x) is software designed for individuals who want to achieve a substance free aesthetic physique.
        We believe an aesthetic physique shows as much muscle definition without compromising health.
        Such a physique requires well-developed lean mass and around 12% body fat for males or 20% body fat for females.
        Body fat percentage is also known as body composition. If your goal is to achieve a different body composition check out our meal plan calculator.</string>
    <string name="ibw3">\t\t\t\t\tIt is important to clarify that an ideal physique is that which you believe is the best.
        Aesthet(x) was developed by a hobbyist natural bodybuilder and engineering student who enjoys a muscular look and quantified the process natural bodybuilding to share with

    <string name="fouryears">The law of diminishing returns takes effect in an individual’s hypertrophy after the first four years of training.
        On average male individuals experience 20, 10, 5 and 2.5 pounds of muscle growth in their first, second, third and fourth year respectively.
        About half that growth is expected for females. Therefore, Aesthet(x) provides insight inside that four-year timeframe. Further development is achievable;
        however, we encourage our users to educate themselves further to achieve desirable results in their intermediate to advanced phase.
